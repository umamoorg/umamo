/*
 * Outliner drop resolution: the pure rules deciding what dropping one outliner row onto another does,
 * over the organisational tree (parts / drawables) and the deformer armature.  The UI reads the band
 * for its indicator and resolves the drop for its dispatch through the SAME functions here, so the
 * line / fill the user sees always matches the move that happens.  The tree transforms themselves
 * (withOrgChildMoved / withDeformerMoved) live in StructureEdits.kt; this file only routes a drop to
 * them.  Mirrors the parameter panel's split (ParametersDropRules in :ui feeds ParameterTreeEdits
 * here) - except the outliner's rules mention no UI types, so the whole resolution lives in :edit.
 *
 * アウトライナーのドロップ解決。行ドロップの帯域判定と移動先の解決を一箇所で行い、指標と実際の
 * 移動が常に一致する。ツリー変換自体は StructureEdits.kt にある。
