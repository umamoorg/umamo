/*
 * Entity deletion over the org tree. Removing a drawable, a deformer, or a part scrubs every dangling
 * reference so no later code dereferences a deleted id. Deleting an art mesh is the only inherently
 * destructive case; deleting a deformer "unwraps" it (its sub-deformers and bound meshes re-home to its
 * parent); deleting a part is either a cascade (the part and its whole subtree) or an ungroup (the folder
 * only, contents spliced up into its parent). Org-tree edits re-derive the render order.
