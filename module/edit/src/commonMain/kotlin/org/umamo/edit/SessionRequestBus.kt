/**
 * The session's request buses: fire-and-forget signals from command handlers to the viewport
 * overlays.  Every one exists for the same reason - the operation needs something only an overlay
 * has (the pointer position, the projected geometry, the in-flight working positions), so the
 * session cannot execute it directly; it signals here and the observing overlay executes.  Pure
 * plumbing with no other session state involved, hence a separate collaborator; [EditorSession]
 * exposes each flow and request method unchanged.
