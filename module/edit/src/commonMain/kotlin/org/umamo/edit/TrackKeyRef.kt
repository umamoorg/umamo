/**
 * One selected keyform key: the parameter section, the row, and WHICH key on that row.
 *
 * By ordinal rather than by parameter value.  Two keys a hair apart are legal and useful, and resolving a
 * value back to a key then picks whichever happens to be nearer - which is how dragging one of a pair of
 * near-coincident marks moved the other.  The parameter is part of the identity because a linked pair
 * renders two sections at once and one item's row key is the same string in both.
 *
 * [rowKey] is an opaque string to this module, and deliberately so.  It is the keyform sheet's row identity,
 * built from the OWNER plus what the row edits (a channel, the geometry, a blend binding) - model identity
 * throughout, so it survives every edit that does not delete the thing it names.  Resolving it back to a
 * track is the sheet's job because only the sheet knows which rows it is currently projecting; a session
 * that tried to would have to duplicate that projection to answer.
 *
 * 選択された1キー：パラメータ区画・行・その行の何番目のキーか。値ではなく序数で指す。
 *
 * @property ParameterId parameterId The parameter whose section the key sits in.
 * @property String rowKey The owning row's stable key.
 * @property Int keyIndex The key's ordinal on that row's track.
