/*
 * Editing the key POSITIONS of a geometry track.
 *
 * Deliberately separate from KeyformChannelEdits: a channel is addressed by (owner, channel) and its cells
 * hold a ChannelValue, while geometry is a privileged per-owner field whose cell type differs by owner
 * (MeshDeltaForm / WarpLatticeForm / RotationPivotForm).  One generic op cannot span both without erasing
 * that distinction, and erasing it is exactly what would let a scalar track reach buildDeltaTexels.
 *
 * These ops move, insert, and remove KEYS; they never author a form.  Authoring geometry needs the posed
 * deformer-chain inverse and stays deferred - but key positions are ordinary grid algebra, and leaving
 * them uneditable made every geometry row in the keyform sheet silently swallow every gesture, which on a
 * corpus rig is nearly every row on screen.
 *
 * ジオメトリトラックのキー位置編集。フォーム自体（変形）のキー打ちは別途。
