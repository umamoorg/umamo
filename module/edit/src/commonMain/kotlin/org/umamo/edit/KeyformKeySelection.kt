/*
 * What a key REMOVAL does to the keyform sheet's key selection.
 *
 * Removing keys renumbers the ones above them: a [TrackKeyRef] names a row and an ordinal on that row's
 * track, so a selection left untouched across a removal stops naming the key the user selected and instead
 * names whichever key slides down onto the freed ordinal.
 *
 * The rule lives in :edit rather than in the sheet because it is a statement about what an edit MEANS, and
 * three call sites need to agree on it - the aimed removal behind Alt+I and the lane menu, the selected-keys
 * removal behind Delete, and the summary-mark removal.  A [TrackKeyRef]'s row key is opaque here, which is
 * all this needs: the algebra compares row keys, it never resolves one.
 */

/**
 * [current] with [removed] taken out and every ordinal that renumbers under them corrected.
 *
 * Only two kinds of ref are at risk from a removal: the removed keys themselves, and the LATER ordinals on
 * the same row, which slide down one place per key removed below them.  Everything else names exactly what
 * it named before, so a mark the user had not selected must leave their selection untouched rather than
 * clearing it wholesale.
 *
 * Matched on the parameter as well as the row because a linked pair renders one row under two sections, and
 * a removal renumbers only the axis it happened on.
 *
 * @param Set<TrackKeyRef> current The selection before the removal.
 * @param Set<TrackKeyRef> removed The keys the removal takes out.
 * @return Set<TrackKeyRef> The selection that survives it.
