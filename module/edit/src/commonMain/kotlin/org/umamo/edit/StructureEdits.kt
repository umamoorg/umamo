/*
 * Organisational-tree structure edits. The org tree (PuppetModel.rootChildren + Part.children - an ordered
 * mix of sub-parts and drawables) is the single source of truth for the hierarchy AND the parts-panel
 * order, and that order is the draw-order tiebreak. So one move - withOrgChildMoved - covers reparenting a
 * part, re-homing a drawable, reordering siblings, and interleaving a drawable between parts; every move
 * re-derives the render order from the tree. Deformer moves are separate (deformers live in the Armature,
 * not the org tree).
 *
 * 組織ツリーの構造編集。ツリーが階層とパネル順の唯一の真実で、描画順のタイブレークでもある。移動は1つに統合。
