 * undo, change events, and dirty-tracking stay consistent.
 *
 * Two channels, per the history design: [changes] emits on every mutation (the "everything emits a
 * change event" completeness), while the history stack records only the undoable subset. A document
 * mutation ([mutate]) and a selection gesture ([setSelection]) each push one step; a mode toggle
 * ([setMode]) and future tool/brush switches are transient — they emit but never become steps.
 *
 * Undo is by immutable snapshot, never inverse op: [undo] / [redo] just republish a stored
 * [EditorSnapshot]. Dirty is reference-equality of the model against the last-saved instance — because
 * undo restores the exact prior model instance and selection-only steps reuse the same instance,
 * `model !== savedModel` is correct across undo/redo and is never tripped by a bare selection change.
 *
 * Held on the UI thread (Compose drives it); the render host observes [model] / [selection] as flows.
