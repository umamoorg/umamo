/*
 * What "key this" and "unkey this" MEAN when the user asks for them - the intent layer over the concrete
 * ops in KeyformTrackEdits / KeyformChannelEdits / KeyformGeometryEdits.
 *
 * Three questions live here: which parameter an edit writes on, whether it acts where the user pointed or
 * where the pose stands, and whether a typed value becomes a pending edit or a static write.  All three are
 * editing SEMANTICS, so they belong in this module - a panel row, a keypress, and a lane context menu must
 * answer them identically, and none of them is the right place to decide.
 *
 * This is also why these are not in :ui, where they started out: taking a Compose-side hover type put
 * authoring rules in the UI module and made them untestable without a composition.  A :ui caller now passes
 * plain data - a track, an optional parameter id, and a KeyformAim - and keeps only the pointer bookkeeping
 * that produced them.
 */

/**
 * Where a keyform edit is aimed: at a place the user named, or at the pose the rig is standing in.
 *
 * The distinction is not cosmetic.  Pointing at a spot on a track is a statement about WHICH spot, so a key
 * lands there rather than at the playhead; and pointing at a track but not at a key means "that key, of
 * which there is none", which must remove nothing rather than falling back to the pose and destroying a key
 * the user never pointed at.
