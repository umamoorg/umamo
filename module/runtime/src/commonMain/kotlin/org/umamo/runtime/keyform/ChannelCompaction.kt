/*
 * The post-import compaction pass: reduce every channel track to the axes and keys it actually needs, and
 * lift a track that never varies into its owner's static field.
 *
 * Cubism keys every channel on every cell of one bundled grid, so straight after the fan-out a typical
 * drawable's opacity track is the same value repeated across the whole grid.  Compacting retires those
 * tracks entirely, which is what turns an imported Cubism rig into a sparse Umamo one - and it is where
 * the split pays for itself: the per-frame scalar blends collapse into field reads.
 *
 * Two rules keep this safe:
 *
 *   - GEOMETRY IS NEVER COMPACTED.  A toggle-part drawable can carry bit-identical geometry across an axis
 *     whose keys deliberately do not bracket the parameter's default; dropping that axis would make the
 *     drawable permanently visible, which is a change to someone's rig, not a change in precision.  It
 *     would also move the delta texture's column layout for no benefit.
 *   - EXACT ONLY.  A key is dropped only when the stored value is bit-equal to the blend of its
 *     neighbours; see KeyformGridCompaction.  A near-miss is a value the rigger chose.
 *
 * Run as a separate model pass rather than inside the importers so it is independently testable and can be
 * switched off wholesale when a result needs bisecting against the un-compacted import.
 *
 * DEFERRED: three importer special cases are now redundant in principle - Cmo3Import's
 * `takeIf { it.axes.isNotEmpty() }` on part tracks, its PartComposite seed from the first form, and
 * Moc3Import's deliberate zero-axis single-cell grid.  They are left in place because removing them is a
 * BEHAVIOUR change, not a cleanup: each decides whether a static part's authored composite or its baked
 * keyform wins, and the compaction-on/off equivalence test cannot see the difference (both sides carry the
 * special case).  Only the corpus parity and C-core oracles would catch a mistake, so they should come out
 * one at a time under those gates rather than as a batch.
