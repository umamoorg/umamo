 * The document's atlas: the pages it packs onto and the tiles packed onto them.

 * This is the source-to-atlas indirection made explicit.  A drawable's uvs address a page, but what
 * they MEAN is a position in its source art, and the placement is the only thing that connects the
 * two - so a repack that moves pixels around a page must move uvs with them and leave the art mapping
 * untouched.  Keeping the placement as model state is what lets a repack be an undoable edit and lets
 * an export write where the art actually went, rather than both guessing from uvs.

/**
 * The policy the atlas's pages are composed under: which alpha counts as opaque when a tile is
 * trimmed to its content, and how far each tile's edge color is replicated into the gutter around it.
 *
 * Model state because the pages are DERIVED state.  A placement records only where a tile's art
 * sits, not which opaque sub-rectangle the packer trimmed it to or how wide a band it extruded, so a
 * derivation re-runs both on the same pixels and must do so under the policy the pack used - held
 * here, beside the placements, so an undo across a repack that changed the threshold re-derives the
 * pages that repack composed rather than the current default's.  Options that only decide WHERE
 * tiles land (gutter, rotation, page shape) leave no trace here: the placements are their record.
 *
 * The defaults match the packer's own defaults; this module cannot see the packer, so the two are
 * kept equal by the derivation gate that composes a pack's pages back from a lowered model.
