/*
 * Exact-only keyform-grid compaction: drop every axis a track does not actually vary along, and every
 * interior key that is bit-equal to the blend of its neighbours.
 *
 * This is what turns an imported Cubism rig into a sparse Umamo one.  Cubism keys every channel on every
 * cell of one bundled grid, so after the per-channel fan-out a typical drawable's opacity track is the
 * same value repeated across the whole grid; compacting it to a constant retires the track entirely and
 * the owner's static field takes over.
 *
 * EXACT, never an epsilon.  A key that is merely close to its interpolated neighbours is a value the
 * rigger chose, and silently replacing it would alter their rig - which the fidelity contract forbids.
 * The greedy drop test compares against the same FormInterpolator expression refinedToUnion re-inserts
 * with, and the drop set is then VERIFIED by running refinedToUnion itself and re-keeping any key whose
 * restored slice is not bit-identical (two adjacent drops restore through a different rounding sequence
 * than the one that justified them): compaction and refinement are mutual inverses by construction.
 *
 * OUT-OF-SPAN SAFETY.  A pose outside any axis's key span makes the whole track fall back to its owner's
 * static, so an axis whose keys do not bracket the parameter's range acts as a GATE - dropping it (or
 * lifting the track to a constant that overwrites the static) would change what those poses render.  The
 * caller supplies the axis-spans-range predicate; a non-spanning axis is never dropped and a track whose
 * last axis is non-spanning is never lifted.
 *
 * 厳密一致のみの格子圧縮。近似値では絶対に削除しない（作者の指定値を書き換えることになるため）。
 * 範囲を張らない軸は静的値への降着を守るゲートなので、決して削除しない。

/**
 * This grid with every redundant axis and interior key removed, or the constant it collapses to.

 * An axis is redundant when every cell is bit-equal along it - the track simply does not respond to that

 * either side, so the evaluator would produce it anyway.  Endpoint keys are never dropped: the blend test
 * needs both neighbours, and dropping an endpoint would narrow the axis's span and change when the track
 * falls out of range.
 *
 * A [valueKind] of FLAG restricts compaction to whole axes.  A flag snaps to the floor cell rather than
 * blending, so "equal to the blend of its neighbours" is not the right test for an interior flag key, and
 * flag tracks are small enough that the conservatism costs nothing.
 *
 * A sparse grid is returned unchanged as [CompactionResult.Reduced] - the missing cells cannot be tested,
 * and inventing them would be a repair this layer has no business making.

 * @param FormInterpolator interpolator The blend and exact-equality tests; must be the same one
 *   [refinedToUnion] will later re-insert with.
 * @param ChannelValueKind? valueKind The track's value kind when it is a channel track, or null for a
 *   geometry grid (which blends like a scalar).
 * @param Function axisSpansRange Whether an axis's keys bracket its parameter's whole range.  A
 *   non-spanning axis gates the track's out-of-span fallback to the owner's static, so it is never
 *   dropped and never lifted; channel compaction MUST pass the model-derived predicate (the permissive
 *   default exists for shape-only tests and single-grid callers with no parameter table in reach).
 * @return CompactionResult The constant the track collapses to, or the reduced grid.
