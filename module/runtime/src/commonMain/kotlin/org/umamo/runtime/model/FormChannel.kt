/*
 * The per-channel keyform tracks: an entity's animatable non-geometry properties, each keyed on its own
 * axes at its own key positions rather than riding one bundled keyform cell.
 *
 * Cubism's keyform cell is all-or-nothing - CArtMeshForm carries positions, draw order, opacity, and the
 * multiply/screen tints together, so keying any one of them keys all of them.  Splitting them lets a
 * rigger key opacity on one parameter without touching geometry, which is the whole point: the bundled
 * shape cannot express it at all.  ONE enum plus ONE map rather than a map per value type, because every
 * generic walk over an entity's channels - the parameter-delete scrub, compaction, the export refine,
 * the dope-sheet track list - needs to iterate them uniformly, and a flag channel fits no scalar/color
 * split.
