 * a generated structural `equals` quietly wrong (the same trap [Keyform] sidesteps by hand). A mesh is

 * @param Float      layerLeft   The layer's canvas x at the last read - the art frame's origin.
 * @param Float      layerTop    The layer's canvas y at the last read.
 * @param Float      tolerance   How far, in pixels, a corner may sit from its texel before the quad
