/*
 * Pose sampling for the per-channel keyform tracks, over the same multilinear corner selection the
 * geometry blend uses.
 *
 * Each channel resolves its OWN corners from its OWN grid rather than borrowing geometry's.  That is not
 * an optimization left on the table - after import compaction a channel track keeps only the axes it
 * actually varies along, so its cell linear indices no longer line up with geometry's and a borrowed
 * corner set would read the wrong cells.  Before compaction the two share axes, so the corners come out
 * identical in identical order and the sums are bit-for-bit what the bundled blend produced.
 *
 * The static fallback applies when the owner has NO track for a channel, or when the track's pose is out
 * of range.  Out of range NEVER hides: hiding is the geometry grid's decision alone, so keying opacity on
 * a narrow parameter cannot make the art vanish at the ends of an unrelated slider.
 *
 * Every read takes an optional OVERRIDE, which wins over both the track and the static.  That is how a
 * value the user has typed but not yet keyed reaches the viewport: the pending edit is not in the document
 * (it is transient session state), so it arrives beside the pose rather than inside the model.
