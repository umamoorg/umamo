/**
 * A deformer in the rig hierarchy.
 *
 * Cubism deformation is parameter-driven morph blending, not skeletal - there are exactly two
 * deformer kinds, so a `sealed interface` captures the closed taxonomy and forces `when`s over it to
 * be exhaustive (adding a third kind becomes a compile error until handled everywhere). Deformers nest
 * via [parent] (the transform hierarchy a drawable inherits); each also belongs to a part via [partId]
 * (the organisational tree) - two independent hierarchies, mirroring CMO3's `targetDeformerGuid` vs
 * `parentGuid`.
 *
 * リグ階層の変形器。Cubism は2種(ワープ／回転)のみ。変形系統([parent])と組織系統([partId])は別。
