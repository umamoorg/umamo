 * A little-or-big-endian random-access reader over a [ByteArray], shared by the codecs that parse
 * structured binary headers (TIFF's II/MM directories, WebP's little-endian RIFF chunks, PSD's
 * big-endian records).
 *
 * Also the common-code replacement for `java.nio.ByteBuffer`, which is why it carries both a cursor
 * and absolute reads: it defaults to big-endian and its [position] behaves like ByteBuffer's, so a
 * big-endian ByteBuffer parser ports across without restructuring.  Offsets are Int (files under
 * 2 GiB); 32-bit fields are read as Long to stay unsigned-safe, with [u32AsInt] for the common
 * in-range case.  [position] advances on the sequential read* methods; the at-offset methods do not
 * move it.
