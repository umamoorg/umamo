/**
 * A [FormatCodec] whose in-memory model is a single flat [RasterImage] - one implementation per flat
 * image format (PNG, BMP, JPEG, WebP, TIFF).
 *
 * The flat-image analogue of [org.umamo.format.art.ArtReader] (which reads a layered layer tree
 * into a SourceArt): a [RasterCodec] reads and, where the format supports it, writes one whole
 * image.  Folding the raster codecs into [FormatCodec] lets [org.umamo.format.FormatRegistry]
 * detect and resolve them exactly like the layered readers and the binary model codecs, rather
 * than through a separate facade (art-sourcing roadmap invariant #5).  A caller that wants a flat
 * decode does `FormatRegistry.detect(bytes) as? RasterCodec` to know the file yields a
 * [RasterImage], then optionally wraps it as source art via [rasterToSourceArt].
