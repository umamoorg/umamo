/**
 * Synthesizes the per-object runtime-slot sections: the 8-byte fields each object block opens with,
 * which are all-zero on disk and filled by the runtime after its memory-cast.
 *
 * These carry no authored data, so a writer only has to SIZE them - but sizing them is not optional.
 * The array must be exactly as long as its object list or the runtime reads past the end of the one
 * it just allocated, which is why a bake cannot simply carry them from a reference file once the
 * object count changes.  That is the whole reason they are modeled at all.
 *
 * Corpus-verified all-zero across every sample by `UnmodeledSectionIdentityProbeTest`.
