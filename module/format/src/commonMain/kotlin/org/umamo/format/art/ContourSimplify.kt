/**
 * Simplifies a closed lattice ring with Douglas-Peucker, returning a subset of its vertices.
 *
 * Closed rings get the standard two-anchor treatment: anchor A is ring index 0 (the tracer's
 * deterministic topmost-then-leftmost start vertex) and anchor B is the vertex farthest from A
 * (ties resolve to the lowest index); the two open halves A->B and B->A are simplified
 * independently, so both anchors always survive.  The walk is iterative over an explicit range
 * stack.  Distances are exact until the final comparison: Long integer dot and cross products,
 * squared distance to the clamped segment (robust for halves that double back), and a strict
 * greater-than against epsilon squared, so epsilon 0 drops exactly-collinear vertices and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * Guarantees: every kept vertex is an original lattice vertex on the exact mask boundary, and
 * every dropped vertex lies within epsilon pixels of a segment of the simplified ring (the
 * Douglas-Peucker construction), so the result deviates from the exact boundary by at most
 * epsilon.  If simplification would leave fewer than 3 points (a 1xN sliver's rectangle at
 * epsilon 1 collapses to its two anchors), the unsimplified ring is returned instead.  Output
 * is deterministic.
 *
 * Known limitation, accepted for v1: on adversarial shapes Douglas-Peucker can produce a
 * self-intersecting simplified ring.  Callers needing a guaranteed-simple polygon should pass
 * a smaller epsilon (or 0) until a topology-preserving variant exists.
 *
 * @param IntArray points Flattened x0, y0, x1, y1, ... closed ring; last point connects to the first.
 * @param Float epsilon Maximum allowed deviation from the input ring, in pixels; non-negative.
 * @return IntArray The simplified ring, or the input array itself when nothing can be dropped.
