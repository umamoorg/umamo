/**
 * `.moc3` container constants and the CountInfo field indices.
 *
 * Section-table INDICES do not live here - every one of them is a [Section] enum entry carrying
 * its element type, sizing rule, and per-version index, so `MocSections` can decode it and the
 * lossless gate can check it.  A second, untyped registry of bare index constants used to sit
 * alongside that enum; the sections it named were invisible to both.  What remains here is the
 * container geometry and the CountInfo field numbers, which are not sections at all.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.umamo.org/format/MOC3.md">MOC3.md §section map</a>
