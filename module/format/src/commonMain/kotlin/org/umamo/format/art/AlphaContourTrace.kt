/**
 * Traces every closed boundary contour of the mask — outer island boundaries and enclosed

 *
 * This is boundary tracing on the pixel-corner lattice (the axis-aligned "outline of the
 * union of pixel squares"), not the midpoint-interpolating marching-squares isoline, which
 * would offset every polygon by half a pixel and cut corners.  The walk keeps opaque pixels
 * on the right of the travel direction (y-down), so outer contours come out with positive
 * shoelace area and holes negative.  Saddle corners (the two diagonal pixels opaque) take the
 * tight right turn, i.e. 4-connected foreground / 8-connected background: a diagonal
 * checkerboard traces as separate unit squares and loops never cross themselves (though one
 * loop may touch itself at a saddle corner).  Vertices are emitted only where the heading
 * changes, so straight runs carry no interior points and the exact ring is already minimal.
 *
 * Discovery is a row-major scan restricted to the trimmed bounds: every loop, outer or hole,
 * contains at least one "north edge" (transparent-or-border pixel above, opaque pixel below),
 * which this winding always walks eastward, so marking traversed north edges in one extra
 * bitset makes each loop discoverable exactly once.  The scan order also pins determinism —
 * each contour starts at its topmost-then-leftmost north edge and contours are listed in that
 * discovery order — which downstream repacking relies on.  Total cost is one bounds-restricted
 * mask scan plus O(total boundary length).
 *
 * Worst case to know about: a 50 percent checkerboard-noise mask yields one unit-square
 * contour per opaque pixel (millions of tiny rings on a large layer).  Pathological input; no
 * mitigation here.
 *
 * @param AlphaMask mask The thresholded pixel mask; must contain at least one opaque pixel.
 * @param LayerBounds opaqueBounds The pixel-tight trimmed bounds of the mask's opaque pixels.
