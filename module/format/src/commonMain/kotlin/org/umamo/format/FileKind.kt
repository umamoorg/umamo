 * The file families Umamo understands, plus the art-source formats it ingests.

 * Modelled as a `sealed interface` so a `when` over kinds is exhaustive (the compiler rejects an
 * unhandled case) - the same enforcement applied to [Cmo3Version]. Each kind declares its
 * capabilities ([readable]/[writable]) and its priority [tier], so dispatch and UI can reason
 * about support without a scattered list of booleans.
