/**
 * Mutation support for a read [Cmo3Model]'s graph, for callers lowering editor state back onto it.
 *
 * The writer replays each read object's recorded child order and attribute presence, so a plain
 * field assignment only reaches the re-emitted document when the source already carried that
 * element/attribute.  This facade exposes the bookkeeping a lowering needs on top of the bare
 * assignments: recording missing slots/attributes, distinguishing read objects from fresh ones,
 * and dropping shared-pool entries orphaned by structural deletes.
