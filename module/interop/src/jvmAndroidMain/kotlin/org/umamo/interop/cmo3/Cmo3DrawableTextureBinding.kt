/**
 * Fits a drawable's atlas-page-to-canvas placement transform: the affine mapping page pixel
 * coordinates (uv times page size) onto the drawable's base mesh positions.
 *
 * CMO3: CTextureInput_TextureAtlasRegion field inputImageLocalToCanvasTransform - the editor
 * inverts this to place the mesh over its texture patch in the atlas and mesh-edit views, so an
 * identity here draws every mesh at its assembled canvas position instead.  Cubism-authored
 * mappings are exact per-drawable affines (the layer's canvas translation composed with the
 * packer's scale, rotation, and translate), so a least-squares fit recovers them to float
 * precision; a degenerate mesh falls back to a single-axis regression, then to a pure centroid
 * translation.
 *
 * The moments are accumulated about the point cloud's MEAN, not about the page origin, and that is
 * load-bearing rather than a tidiness preference.  A patch sits thousands of pixels out on a
 * 16384-square page while spanning only a few hundred, so origin-referenced moments are dominated
 * by the offset: the system's conditioning picks up the squared offset-to-spread ratio, the
 * informative pivot falls far below any offset-scaled singularity tolerance, and a perfectly
 * determined fit is rejected as degenerate.  What it degrades to - a per-axis regression - cannot
 * express an off-diagonal term at all, so a drawable the packer rotated comes back squashed onto
 * the wrong axis.  Centering drops the offset term outright: the solve sees only the cloud's own
 * shape, and the translation comes back from the means.
 *
 * A packing that rotates or mirrors the patch is therefore carried faithfully.  The crop the image
 * chain slices out is still the axis-aligned uv bounding box, which for a rotated patch encloses
 * the art plus its surrounding page pixels - that is a property of reconstructing source art from a
 * baked page, and real source art removes it along with the fit itself.
 *
 * This fit exists only because a MOC3-origin export has to RECONSTRUCT the placement a CMO3 would
 * have read straight off its source art - see [Cmo3ImageChainBuilder]'s header for why that whole
 * reconstruction is a stopgap.  A residual survives it by construction for any drawable under a
 * warp deformer: the exported base mesh is the rest pose pushed through the warp's lattice, whose
 * bilinear map is not affine, so no CAffine reproduces it exactly.  The fit is the closest affine,
 * which is what the atlas view needs.
 *
 * @param FloatArray uvs        Interleaved atlas-frame texture coordinates (u then v per vertex).
