/**
 * Converts a puppet with NO retained CMO3 graph (a MOC3-origin or artwork-origin document) into a
 * fresh Cmo3Model: the blank skeleton plus the image chain are synthesized, serialized, and read
 * back through the normal codec, then the ordinary reconcile lowers the whole puppet onto the empty
 * baseline as created entities.  Stateless - each call builds a new graph; the caller writes the
 * result with Cmo3.write.
 *
 * The file this produces opens and renders in the official Cubism Editor and switches between its
 * layered-art and texture-atlas display modes.  An artwork-origin document writes its REAL source
 * art: every tile with a raster and an inventory row becomes a layer of its file's layered image
 * ([Cmo3SourceLayerWeb]), so the export is the shape the editor writes for its own PSD import and
 * reopens with the same layer identities.  A MOC3-origin document has none of that: a .moc3
 * carries only the packed pages, so [Cmo3ImageChainBuilder] fabricates a source document by slicing
 * the packed atlas back apart, every layer in that output is a slice of a baked page rather than the
 * artwork the rig was drawn from, and the report leads with MissingSourceArt for as long as any
 * drawable's art came out of a page.
 *
 * One open issue at scale: modelF (~850 MB, several hundred layers) OOMs the official editor when
 * switched back to texture-atlas mode.  Atlas mode recomposites the page from the materials, so
 * peak memory tracks the TOTAL crop area this builder emits rather than the page size - measure
 * that ratio before treating it as an editor limit.
 *
 * The CMO3-origin path ([Cmo3Export.apply] onto a retained graph) keeps the document's real
 * layered art, and its byte-identity gates hold.

	 * drawables' texture) where the editor's own files share a single one by reference.

	 * document can carry an atlas while its drawables sample per-layer rasters instead), and the test
	 * is identity because a CImageResource has no value equality.  With the twin resource in place
