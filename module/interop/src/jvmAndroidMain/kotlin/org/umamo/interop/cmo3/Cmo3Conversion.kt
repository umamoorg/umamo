/**
 * Converts a puppet with NO retained CMO3 graph (a MOC3-origin document) into a fresh Cmo3Model:
 * the blank skeleton plus the per-page image chain are synthesized, serialized, and read back
 * through the normal codec, then the ordinary reconcile lowers the whole puppet onto the empty
 * baseline as created entities.  Stateless - each call builds a new graph; the caller writes the
 * result with Cmo3.write.
 *
 * KNOWN GAP (2026-08-03): the file this produces LOADS cleanly in the official Cubism Editor -
 * correct part/deformer hierarchy, parameters, and texture atlas - but the puppet does NOT render
 * there.  It is a documented functionality gap rather than an open defect, because a .moc3 does
 * not carry the SOURCE ART a CMO3 is built around: [Cmo3ImageChainBuilder] can only fabricate a
 * source document by slicing the packed atlas back apart, and that reconstruction is what the
 * art-sourcing pipeline replaces (docs/plan/art-sourcing-pipeline.md Phase H - an imported MOC3
 * will reconcile its original PSD/CLIP/KRA before it can emit a valid CMO3).  CMO3.md section
 * Fresh-Graph Synthesis records what differential testing against Cubism's own golden file and a
 * third-party converter already RULED OUT (geometry, coordinate-frame sign, element shape, null
 * coverage, and the source-art web itself), so start there rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * The CMO3-origin path ([Cmo3Export.apply] onto a retained graph) is unaffected - it keeps the
 * document's real layered art, and its byte-identity gates hold.

	 * Re-points each page texture at the RE-READ atlas's own page resource.

	 * the graph read back out of the assembled bytes.  Left alone the document ends up with two
	 * equal-but-distinct resources per page (one under the atlas's cachedAtlasImage, one under the
	 * drawables' texture) where the editor's own files share a single one by reference.
	 *
	 * That split is not cosmetic: whether a drawable's uvs are page-frame is decided by whether the
	 * resource it samples IS one of the atlases' page resources (docs/format/CMO3.md section 6 - a
	 * document can carry an atlas while its drawables sample per-layer rasters instead), and the test
	 * is identity because a CImageResource has no value equality.  With the twin resource in place

	 * inverse and draws atlas-frame uvs straight onto the layer crop.
