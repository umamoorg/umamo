/**
 * Lowers a [PuppetModel] into a [MocDocument] - the semantic half of writing a `.moc3` from a rig
 * that may never have been one.
 *
 * This is a FULL SYNTHESIS, deliberately unlike the CMO3 export's state-based reconcile.  That
 * reconcile exists to preserve unmodeled XML the writer does not understand; a MOC3 has no such
 * payload once every section index is modeled, so there is nothing to carry and a reference
 * container would only constrain the output.  A CMO3-origin or future UMA-origin document
 * therefore exports exactly like a MOC3-origin one.
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT, which every geometry path here depends on:
 * `drawable.mesh.positions[i] + cell.positionDeltas[i]` is the drawable's ABSOLUTE position in its
 * parent-deformer space, for every document origin.  `restMeshesToCanvasSpace` rewrites the base
 * and compensates the deltas so the sum is untouched, and CMO3 stores the same mixed-space
 * convention natively - which is what lets one lowering serve both.
 *
 * An export ALWAYS writes.  Anything it cannot express becomes an [ExportNotice] rather than a
 * silent drop, including hidden objects, which are CARRIED with their flag clear rather than
 * deleted the way the official editor's bake deletes them.
 *
 * This object is only the orchestrator.  The work sits in per-concern producers beside it -
 * [resolveExportEligibility] for what gets written at all, then [lowerParameters], [lowerRenderOrder],
 * [lowerParts], [lowerDeformers], [lowerArtMeshes], [lowerGlues], [lowerOffscreens], and
 * [lowerBlendShapes] - over one immutable [Moc3ExportContext] and two collaborators each producer
 * takes explicitly: the [Moc3KeyformPool] it interns bindings into and the [Moc3ExportNotices] it
 * reports through.  A producer's signature is therefore the statement of what it can change.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.umamo.org/format/MOC3.md">MOC3.md §5.6</a>

	 * The pixels-per-unit a bake of [puppet] should carry.
	 *
	 * A moc's canvas scale is a BAKE parameter, not a project property: every corpus `.cmo3` stores
	 * `CModelInfo.pixelsPerUnit = 1` - a CMO3 works in canvas pixels - while the editor's bake of the
	 * same project writes a real scale, and the rigger picks it in the export dialog.  Its default there
	 * is the canvas WIDTH, which 21 of the 25 corpus bakes use exactly (the four that do not chose their
	 * own: 9000 -> 5000, 9000 -> 3077, 4500 -> 3000, 5134 -> 5000).
	 *
	 * So a CMO3-origin export defaults to the canvas width, and a MOC3-origin one keeps the scale its
	 * file already had.  Writing the project's literal 1 instead is not a smaller choice - it stores the
	 * whole rig at PIXEL scale, which every runtime then draws hundreds of times too large.  A rigger who
	 * picked a different scale at bake time cannot have it recovered from the project; that wants an
	 * export option, on the same surface an omit-hidden-objects toggle would live on.
	 *
	 * The two cases are told apart by [PuppetModel.pixelsPerUnit] being NULL, never by the value's
	 * magnitude: 1 is a legitimate bake scale, so a `> 1` test would silently rescale a moc that baked
	 * at 1 - or at any scale below it - by the canvas width and shrink the rig by that whole factor.
