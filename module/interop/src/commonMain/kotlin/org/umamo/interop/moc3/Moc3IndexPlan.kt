/**
 * Every ordering and index decision an export makes, resolved ONCE.
 *
 * A `.moc3` is entirely index-addressed - a drawable names its part and its deformer by list
 * position, a deformer names its parent, a render-order child names a drawable.  So the file
 * order of each object list is not a detail: it is the addressing scheme, and every lowering has
 * to agree on it exactly.  Resolving it here means a lowering can only ask "what index is this
 * id?" and never invent an answer.
 *
 * Two orderings are load-bearing rather than arbitrary.  Parts and deformers are emitted
 * PARENT-BEFORE-CHILD because every corpus file is written that way (parent index < own index,
 * universally, v1 through v6) and the runtime's own single forward pass over the deformer list
 * depends on it - a child seen before its parent would read an unresolved transform.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.umamo.org/format/MOC3.md">MOC3.md §5.6</a>
