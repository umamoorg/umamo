/**
 * Removes from a copy of the rig everything the export target's runtime cannot load.
 *
 * A MOC3 version is a hard capability boundary: a Cubism 3.0 MOC3 has nowhere to put a blend shape, a colour
 * table, or an offscreen, and the sections that would carry them do not exist in its table.  Dropping
 * them at the SECTION level is not enough - the CountInfo would still count the keyforms a stripped
 * section no longer holds - so the removal happens here, on the [PuppetModel], before any lowering
 * runs.  The lowering then sees one shape it can express completely.
 *
 * Reporting is the other half of the reason: a notice raised here names entities the rigger
 * recognises ("Warp40", "ParamAngleX"), while the same loss detected after lowering could only name
 * section indices.
 *
 * What can be carried is asked of the SECTION TABLE, not of [RuntimeTarget.supports].  The two ladders
 * are close but not the same, and where they differ the section table is the one that decides what a
 * file can hold: [RuntimeTarget] follows the official editor's target dialog, which gates the reversed
 * mask at Cubism 4.0 and the parameter repeat at Cubism 5.3 even though both are carried by every MOC3 version back
 * to v1.  Stripping on the editor's ladder would make a v5 file that uses either one round-trip
 * LOSSILY through a v5 export - which is what the corpus showed the moment this was tried
 * (LimeBirb's repeating parameters).  RuntimeTarget's own docblock anticipates this and says so: edit
 * gating is editor parity, the section-level nuances belong to export lowering.
 *
 * The consequence is that a pre-export confirmation built on
 * [org.umamo.runtime.model.unsupportedFeaturesInUse] can name a feature this does not strip.  That is
 * the conservative direction (it over-warns, never under-warns), and the report returned here is what
 * actually happened.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.umamo.org/format/MOC3.md">MOC3.md § Export</a>
