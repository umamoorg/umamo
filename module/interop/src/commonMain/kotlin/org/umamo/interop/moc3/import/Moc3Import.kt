/**
 * Maps a decoded MOC3 document (`:format`) plus its optional cdi3 display info into the concrete
 * [PuppetModel] (`:runtime`) - the baked-runtime counterpart of `Cmo3Import`.
 *
 * MOC3 references everything by index (list position), so the mapping is a single pass over each
 * list with index → id tables built up front.  Three format gaps shape the result:
 *
 *  - Coordinate space.  MOC3 keyform positions are absolute values in the OWNING OBJECT'S PARENT
 *    SPACE, and every parent space but the root matches the runtime's convention VERBATIM (verified
 *    value-for-value against the CMO3 corpus twin): normalized lattice (u, v) under a warp parent and
 *    the pixel-scale local frame under a rotation parent, angles in degrees with the same sign.  Only
 *    the root space differs - the MOC stores model units around CanvasInfo's origin, same Y-down
 *    orientation - so root-space values map through the affine canvas = origin + ppu·model (see
 *    [Moc3ImportContext.pointSpaceOf]).  The one unit seam: a rotation parented to the root or a warp
 *    carries the px→model factor in its keyform scale, so those scales multiply by ppu to land in the
 *    runtime's pixel world; rotation-parented rotations keep their scale verbatim.  One caveat: the
 *    runtime's rest mesh (Drawable.mesh.positions) is canvas-space EDITING geometry in the CMO3
 *    convention, which a MOC does not store - this import leaves the rest mesh in parent space (exact
 *    for evaluation, since the base cancels out of the keyform blend), and `:render`'s
 *    restMeshesToCanvasSpace finishes the job by evaluating the default pose (the document loader
 *    applies it).
 *  - Names.  The binary stores ids (deformers included, §5.6 s11) but no display names; parameter/part
 *    names come from cdi3.json when present, and everything else falls back to the format id - the same
 *    rule `Cmo3Import` uses for an unnamed source.  A deformer's authored label is lost for good (the
 *    bake drops it and cdi3 carries no deformer entries), so its name is the id, plus the drawable it
 *    deforms when exactly one is in reach: "Warp40 (ArtMesh5)".
 *  - Blend shapes.  MOC3 records store per-key DELTAS relative to the object's grid form at the
 *    DEFAULT pose (MOC3.md §5.6), while the runtime `BlendShapeBinding` keeps grid-convention
 *    forms (MeshForm rest-relative; Warp/RotationForm absolute) and the evaluator re-subtracts
 *    that same grid-at-default reference.  The mapping therefore ADDS the reference back when
 *    synthesizing each form - computed with the shared org.umamo.runtime.eval sampling helpers,
 *    the exact functions the evaluator later calls, so the round trip cancels to ULP.  Delta
 *    geometry converts like the grid keyforms minus the origin term (a delta in root space scales
 *    by ppu only; lattice/rotation-local deltas pass through; the rotation-scale ppu seam applies
 *    to scale deltas too).  Neutral form slots import as null (the stored neutral row is all-zero).
 *    PART-owned records carry only a draw-order delta (a part has no other blendable channel) and
 *    ingest onto [org.umamo.runtime.model.Part.blendShapes].  Offscreens ingest into
 *    [org.umamo.runtime.model.PartComposite] per owner part (packed blend int, flags, mask indices)
 *    - the part's group mode becomes Isolated - with the keyformed opacity/color channels merged
 *    into the part's `PartForm` grid (they ride the same cells, MOC3 §5.6).
 *
 * This object is only the orchestrator.  The work sits in per-concern producers beside it -
 * [importParameters], [importParameterLinks], [importParameterTree], [importDeformers],
 * [importDrawables], [importGlues], [importRenderRoot], and [importParts] - over one immutable
 * [Moc3ImportContext].  There is no mutable collaborator to pass alongside it, unlike the export's
 * keyform pool and notice sink: an import reports nothing and interns nothing, so a producer's whole
 * input is the context.
 *
