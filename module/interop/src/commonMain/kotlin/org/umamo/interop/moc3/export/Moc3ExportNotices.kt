/**
 * The advisory findings a lowering accumulates, in the order a rigger will read them.
 *
 * An export ALWAYS writes; anything it cannot express lands here instead of being silently dropped.
 * The order is user-visible - the editor logs the report as a list and shows it in the export panel -
 * so the two positional decisions are stated rather than inherited from whatever order the producers
 * happen to run in: the version strip's own notices come FIRST (they describe the rig the rest of the
 * lowering then worked on), and the dropped-drawable flush comes LAST.
 *
 * Mutable on purpose, and passed to each producer explicitly rather than hidden inside the export
 * context, so a producer's signature says whether it can report.
