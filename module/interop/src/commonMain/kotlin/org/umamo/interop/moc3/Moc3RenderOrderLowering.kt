/**
 * Lowers the runtime's render tree into the MOC3's draw-group records.
 *
 * The shapes already correspond: a MOC3 draw group holds an ordered child list where each child is
 * either an art mesh or a nested group tagged with the part that supplies its depth, and
 * `RenderGroup` is that same thing.  Group 0 is the root by convention, and records are allocated
 * in the order the tree is walked so a parent always precedes its children.
 *
 * The format has one hard rule worth stating: EVERY art mesh must appear exactly once across the
 * whole tree.  A runtime that finds a drawable referenced twice, or not at all, is documented as
 * free to behave erratically - so the guarantee has to arrive with the tree rather than be checked
 * here: the render tree the import builds supplies it through its own append-the-missing safety
 * net, and this walk preserves that shape, skipping only a child whose drawable or part could not
 * be written at all.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://docs.umamo.org/format/MOC3.md">MOC3.md §5.6</a>
