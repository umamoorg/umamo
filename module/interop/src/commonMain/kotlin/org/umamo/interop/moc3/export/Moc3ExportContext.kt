 * Everything the export producers derive from a rig before any of them writes a record.

 * Immutable, and deliberately narrower than the encode side's `MocLoweringContext`: the two things a
 * producer MUTATES - the keyform pool it interns bindings into and the notice sink it reports through -
 * are passed alongside this rather than held here, so a producer's signature says what it changes.
 *
 * The rig here is the STRIPPED one.  A producer that reached back to the caller's model would read
 * features the target version cannot carry, and on every export at a model's own version the two are
 * the same object - so nothing would notice.
