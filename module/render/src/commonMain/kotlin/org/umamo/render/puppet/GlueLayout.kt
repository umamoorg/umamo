/**
 * One glue mesh's per-vertex weld attributes, parallel arrays indexed by the mesh's own vertex index.
 *
 * A vertex that is not glued points at ITSELF with weight 0 - a weld that is arithmetically a no-op
 * (`own + (own - own) * 0`), which is why the shader needs no "is this vertex glued" branch beyond the
 * cheap [glueIndex] test.
 *
 * Three arrays rather than one packed byte blob deliberately. The packed form is a GL vertex-attribute
 * layout (12 bytes/vertex, native byte order), and encoding it here would put a backend's memory layout
 * into shared code AND force this module to invent an endianness convention that the GL side would then
 * have to honour silently. What each vertex welds to is shared; how the bytes sit is the backend's.
 *
 * @property IntArray   partnerIndex Per vertex: the partner's GLOBAL index in the shared position store,
 *   or the vertex's own global index when it is not glued.
 * @property IntArray   glueIndex    Per vertex: which glue supplies the per-pose intensity, or -1 when
 *   not glued.
 * @property FloatArray weldWeight   Per vertex: how far to move toward the partner (0 when not glued).

 *
 * The offsets are assigned by walking [PuppetModel.drawables] in order and giving each glue mesh the next
 * region, so that iteration order DEFINES the addressing.  Both the GPU write (pass 1 deforms each mesh
 * into its own region) and the GPU read (pass 2 fetches a partner by global index) depend on producer and

 * @note A glue pair whose vertex index is outside its mesh throws here, whereas the CPU weld
 *   (`applyGluesResolved`) silently skips it.  That divergence predates this extraction and is preserved
 *   rather than quietly papered over - a malformed pair should be dealt with deliberately, not by two
 *   different behaviours in two backends.
