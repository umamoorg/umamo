/**
 * The GPU backend seam: one implementation per graphics API.
 *
 * Everything above it - the puppet renderer, the deform eval, the pose resolution, the model diff - is
 * backend-neutral.  Desktop OpenGL 3.3 core is implemented; Android GLES 3.0 is a near-transliteration of
 * it (the two differ in binding style, not semantics); iPadOS Metal is a later port.
 *
 * Shaped for the GL family first, deliberately.  Where avoiding a GL-ism costs nothing it is avoided -
 * passes name their target, pipelines are immutable, uniforms are structs - because those read better
 * regardless.  Where pre-solving Metal would cost real complexity for a backend that does not exist yet,
 * it is not done; that bill is paid if and when Metal asks for it.
 *
 * A device is created by the host, which owns whatever context or queue the backend needs, and is used
 * from ONE thread only - the render thread.
 *
 * Two kinds of work sit on this interface.  Drawing is RECORDED into a frame: [beginFrame] hands out a
 * [FrameEncoder] whose passes must all be begun and ended within one begin/end.  The remaining
 * operations - [resolve], [beginReadback] / [pollReadback], [readPixels], and every resource create /
 * destroy - are SELF-CONTAINED: each is a complete unit of work on its own, called outside any frame, and
 * a backend that records into command buffers (Metal) is free to open and commit its own buffer internally
 * to service one.  They are not part of a FrameEncoder because they do not compose with a pass - a resolve
 * runs between a render frame and its read-back, and a read-back is polled across many later frames.
 *
 * GPU バックエンドの継ぎ目。GL / GLES / Metal ごとに実装する。描画はフレームに記録し、resolve / 読み戻し /
 * リソース操作はフレーム外の自己完結操作。
