 *
 * A layer reorder or a reparent that does not change control-point ownership needs no buffer work at all
 * (every drawable is a no-op [Keep]); a base-mesh move re-uploads positions; a UV edit re-uploads UVs; and
 * a structural change - a drawable added, removed, remeshed, or reparented across the warp boundary (which
 * gains or loses its control-point texture) - frees and re-uploads whole.
 *
 * The diff is keyed by drawable id (so it is robust to a simultaneous reorder) and by ARRAY REFERENCE
 * identity: the edit path is copy-on-write, so an untouched drawable keeps its exact array instances and
 * is skipped by an `!==` test without comparing any element.
 *
 * @param PuppetModel model                   The model the residency currently reflects.
 * @param PuppetModel newModel                The edited model.
 * @param Map         residentVertexCountById Each resident drawable's uploaded vertex count.  An INPUT
 *   rather than something derived from [model], and deliberately so: a drawable whose mesh went null is
 *   kept resident, after which [model] no longer carries the count its buffers were built at - only the
 *   backend still knows it.  Its keys are also the authoritative "what is resident" set, which is not the
 *   same as [model]'s drawables (one with no geometry is skipped at upload).
 * @return ModelDiff The reconcile plan.
 * @pre Call BEFORE reassigning the backend's current model - the diff reads [model] as the state the
 *   GPU buffers still match.
