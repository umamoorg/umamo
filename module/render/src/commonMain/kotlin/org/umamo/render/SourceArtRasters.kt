/**
 * A document's source-art pixels, decoded on demand and keyed by atlas tile.
 *
 * Pixels only.  Which tiles exist, how big they are, and where each one packs are model state
 * (`PuppetModel.atlas`), because a repack authors them; this holds the one thing a model must not,
 * since a raster in the model would ride along in every undo snapshot.
 *
 * Nothing is decoded until it is asked for: a CMO3 document loads synchronously on the UI thread, so
 * decoding every tile up front would stall the open by seconds on a real model.  A decoded tile is
 * retained for the store's life, which is the document's life - a replaced document drops the store.
 *
 * Format-agnostic by construction: the decoder is injected.  A CMO3 document supplies one over its
 * retained graph's PNG bytes ([fromPng]); an artwork-origin document, whose reader already decoded
 * every layer, supplies one over those rasters directly.
 *
 * @property Function decode Yields a tile's decoded pixels, or null when it has none or they will not
 *   decode.  Called from any thread, possibly several at once, so it must share nothing mutable - and
 *   it must return the SAME instance for the same tile on every call when it can, because the
 *   renderer's texture cache and the viewport's freshness test compare decoded images by identity.
