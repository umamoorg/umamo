/**
 * The viewport's offscreen surface pair: a supersampled draw target the renderer draws into, and a
 * display-size resolve target the draw is box-downscaled into for read-back.
 *
 * Backend-neutral - both targets and the resolve come from the [device], so every backend's viewport
 * host shares this class instead of re-owning two framebuffers apiece.  The draw target is write-only
 * (`sampled = false`, a renderbuffer on GL); the resolve target is sampled so it can be read back.
 *
 * Allocation is GROW-ONLY: the targets are kept at a per-axis high-water capacity and each render
 * uses only its bottom-left (render-origin) used region, resolved and read back at the used size.
 * A gutter drag resizes the viewport every frame, and one surface is shared by every area, so
 * differently-sized areas alternate sizes render-to-render - a recreate-on-any-change policy paid a
 * framebuffer destroy + create per frame in both cases.  The cost is that the session retains the
 * high-water allocation (a 2x draw target at 4K is about 130 MB).
 *
 * All calls run on the render thread with the device's context current; this class never crosses
 * threads.
 *
 * ビューポートのオフスクリーン面：スーパーサンプル描画ターゲットと表示サイズの解決ターゲットの対。
 * 確保は拡大のみ（高水位容量）で、各描画は原点寄せの使用領域だけを使う。
 *
 * @property RenderDevice device The backend the targets live on.
 * @property Int          scale  The maximum framebuffer pixels per display pixel (the full
 *   supersample factor).  It bounds ensure's activeScale; capacity itself follows the high-water of
 *   the pixel sizes actually requested, so a session that never renders above 1x never pays a 2x
 *   allocation, and the first higher-scale render grows the targets once.
 *
 * @note Shrink-on-idle (trimming the high-water allocation after a quiet period) is the named
 *   future refinement if the retained memory ever matters in practice.
