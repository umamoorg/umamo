 * enforceable up front instead of after the memory is already spent.

 * the heap holds one chunk rather than the document's whole artwork.  A rig whose layers would be a
 * gigabyte decoded costs a few tens of megabytes to stream.

 * placement changes.  Deciding the mapping separately from paying for the pixels is what lets a budget
 * be applied before any memory is spent, and what keeps a budget-evicted layer promotable later.
