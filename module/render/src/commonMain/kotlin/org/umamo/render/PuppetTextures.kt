 * [premultipliedAlpha] is the OR-fold of the CMO3 `GTexture2D.isPremultiplied` bits and is currently
 * UNCONSUMED - and is deliberately kept that way.  It is an editor texture-upload-convention flag
 * (serialized true on nearly every model), NOT a claim that the decoded bytes are premultiplied: every
 * ingested page is straight-alpha (PngCodec yields straight alpha; the fragment shader premultiplies
 * in-shader with source factor GL_ONE), so wiring this to "unpremultiply the bytes" would over-darken
 * the whole corpus.  The version-dependent premultiplied-vs-straight COMPOSITING distinction (Cubism
 * 5.2 and earlier plus the "(Before 5.3)" modes composite premultiplied; 5.3+ Color blend composites
 * straight) is a separate axis, carried by `BlendMode.isLegacy` and handled in
 * `BlendMath.compositeReference`, not by this field.  See docs/format/CMO3.md, "Premultiplied vs
 * straight alpha".
